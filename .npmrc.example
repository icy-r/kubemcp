# .npmrc.example - Configuration for publishing to both npm and GitHub Packages
# Copy this to .npmrc for local development/publishing

# Default registry (npm)
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# For installing scoped packages from GitHub Packages
# Uncomment and add your GitHub Personal Access Token if you want to install from GitHub Packages
# @icy-r:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
# //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN

# Note: The release workflow handles publishing to both registries automatically
# You don't need to configure .npmrc for automated releases
